This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Install and use the correct version of Node using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

    ```bash
    nvm install
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## 🛠️ Building for Production

1. Build the static site

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

Site files can be found in the `out` folder after the build completes.
